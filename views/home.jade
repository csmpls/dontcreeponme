			p	DCOM is a simple, multimedia-enabled chat that does not track you in any way. Messages are never stored on our servers - they're transmitted only to people who are in the chatroom at the time you sent your message. The idea is to build a chat app that's about as ephemeral as real-life conversation.
			p 	Go to dontcreepon.me/[anythinghere] to make a new chatroom. Share that URL with whomever you'd like to chat with.
